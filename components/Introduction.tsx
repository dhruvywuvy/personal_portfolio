        hey there, i'm dhruv! i'm from singapore, the little red dot. over the years, i've had a blast exploring different passions: starting as a freelance photographer at 14, sharing my photos with millions online.

        since then, i've made + published music 🎶, served in the air force ✈️, built software for the fortune 500💻.

        <b>now:</b> after recovering from military injuries 🤕, i've become deeply grateful for the healthcare heroes 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️ who helped me out. to pay it forward, my cofounder and i are building advocare to make sure no one ever overpays for medical bills again 💸🚫.
