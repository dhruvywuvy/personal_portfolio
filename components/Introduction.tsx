    👋 hey there! i'm dhruv, a passionate creator on a journey of endless exploration! 🚀 my adventure began at 14 as a freelance photographer, capturing the beauty of my hometown singapore and sharing it with millions online. 🎨

    <br></br><br></br>

    since then, i've dived into various exciting fields. i've produced music 🎵, served in the air force 🛩️, and developed software for the Fortune 500.

    🏥 currently, my team and i are pouring our hearts into something truly meaningful. 
    inspired by my own experiences with injuries during military service + conversations with people navigating the maze that is the healthcare system,
    we're building advocare so that no one ever overpays for medical bills again 💸 🚫.
